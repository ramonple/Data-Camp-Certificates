Graphical processing units enabled the development of deep learning models from neural networks. 
When does a neural network become a deep learning model?
--> When more hidden layers are added to a neural network.

Cassava plants are a key food security crop in Sub-Saharan Africa but viral diseases are a major source of poor yields. 
A survey in Uganda has yielded a dataset with over 20,000 labelled images of healthy and diseased cassava plants. 
What kind of machine learning technique would most likely produce the best results in helping to identify common cassava plant diseases from the images?
--> Neural Network

What is meant by a precision of 60% for a classification model that classifies an email as spam or not spam?
--> this means that if the model classified 10 emails as spam. then 6 of those emails would be spam.

[ precision ] = TP/ ( TP + FP ) What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?

[ Recall / Sensitivity ] = TP/ (TP + FN) What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?


The Null hypothesis is a statement about the population parameters.
